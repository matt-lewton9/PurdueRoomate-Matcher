This project was to help incoming freshman find roommates on the Purdue Class of 2025 Discord server.

There was a spreadsheet on the Discord where over 100 students filled out information, however, such a large spreadsheet was difficult to analyze manually to find roommates you might be similar to.

This program analyzed the unformatted text, and comapred differen't rommate's entries to create a "compatibility score".

The spreadheet of compatibility scores was then published to the Discord server, and helped many students, including myself, find a roommate.
